This is a chrome extension to help track sites during research or exploration. Sites are represented as nodes in a tree. When you navigate to a related page or begin a search based off of information found, you can add that search or new page as children of your current page or as unconnected nodes. Unread nodes are marked so that you can easily return to them without leaving the tab open.
